					<h2>Becoming a Wisewire Author</h2>

					<h3>What is a Wisewire Author?</h3>
					<p>Author is a special role assigned to contributors whose content passes our quality rubric for inclusion in our marketplace. </p>

					<h3>What are the benefits of becoming a Wisewire Author?</h3>
					<p>Once you become a Wisewire author, you may publish materials directly to the marketplace. You no longer have to wait for your content to be approved – you can choose to publish it on the site for others to use or you can keep it private for your own use. The choice is yours! Non-authors can only have unlisted questions and assessments. Unlisted content can always be accessed if you know the URL (link location) but will not show up on our search or browse pages in the marketplace.
					A badge highlighting your status will show up next to your name.
					</p>

					<ul class="badges">
						<li><img src="faq-wan/img/large_bronze.png" alt="Bronze Author badge" style="padding-right:10px;"> <b>Bronze Author</b></li>
						<li><img src="faq-wan/img/large_silver.png" alt="Silver Author badge" style="padding-right:10px;"> <b>Silver Author</b></li>
						<li><img src="faq-wan/img/large_gold.png" alt="Gold Author badge" style="padding-right:10px;"> <b>Gold Author</b></li>
					</ul> 

					<p>Wisewire Authors will also be able to choose whether or not to charge for their contributions. Put simply, you can decide whether you want to charge for your content or if it will be free for others to use.</p>

					
					<h3>How do I become a Wisewire Author?</h3>
					<p>Becoming a Wisewire Author is easy! Publish 3 or more items and select “Publish to Marketplace” when you’re done. Our team will receive a notification to evaluate your submissions and will email you of your status once they’ve been reviewed. Meanwhile, your items will be featured on the marketplace under the Pending Wisewire Author headline on users’ personalized homepages.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Bronze Authors</b> must have written at least three questions.</li>
						<li><b>Silver Authors</b> must have written at least 20 questions.</li>
						<li><b>Gold Authors</b> must have written at least 100 questions.</li>
					</ul> 
					<h3>Why do some users have a crown icon next to their names?</h3>
					<p class="last">Users with the crown icon(<img style="margin:0" src="faq-wan/img/crown.png" width="19" height="18" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-599">) are publishers who work with Wisewire to help provide free questions to everyone.</p>
