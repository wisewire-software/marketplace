            institutions or

            partners

                <p> The online learning experience has crossed the threshold of
                    being more robust and
                    immersive
                    than its traditional counterpart. This is due to advancing technology used in
                    learning

                    Increase Graduation Rates
                </h3>
                <p>Students earning their degrees online have higher graduation
                    rates (just take a look
                    at
                    Pennsylvania State University World Campus, University of Florida, George

                    University, and Marist College to name a few that have graduation rates higher than
                    80%).
                    These students are able to take courses at their own pace and in a setting that
                    they feel
                    most comfortable. This results in a more conducive learning experience and yields a

                    for
                    prospective students outside of your location. The ease of accessibility and higher
