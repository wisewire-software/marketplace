                    Wisewire identifies experiences necessary to expose students to concepts
                    needed for our digitally connected global economy.
                    Projects and knowledge units are then carefully designed to fit with the existing standards-aligned
                    approach.
                    The result are course frameworks that meet outcome requirements and jumpstart development.
                    Our frameworks consist of projects, knowledge units, enhanced-assessments, and other learning
                    resources.
